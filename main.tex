Me trying to explain some of the most famous quantum algorithms

\section{Search Algorithms}
Search through a list of $N$ elements. We focus on the indexes and not on the specific elements.
% Marginnote
\marginnote{We number the indexes Python style}
The indexes goes from $0$ to $N-1$. For convinience we assume $N=2^n$, so the index can be stored in $n$ bits. Many search problems can have multiple, equally acceptable, solutions. Let $f(x)$ be function with the property that $f(x)=1$ if $x$ is a solution. If there are $N$ items to search amongst, of which there are exactly $M$ solutions, $1\leq M \leq N$.
\begin{align*}
  f(x)&=0,\Rightarrow\text{$x$ is not a solution},\\
  f(x)&=1,\Rightarrow\text{$x$ is a solution}.
\end{align*}
Suppose we have a \textit{quantum oracle} – a black box whose internl workings we will discuss later. This recognition is signalled by making use of an \textit{oracle qubit}.


We also need an oracle to recognize the solutions to the search problem.
\begin{equation}
  \ket{x}\ket{q}\xrightarrow{\operator}\ket{x}\ket{q\oplus f(x)},
\end{equation}
where $\ket{x}$ is the index register, $\oplus$ denotes addition modulo 2, and the oracle qubit $\ket{q}$ is a single qubit which is flipped if $f(x)=1$, and is unchanged otherwise. We can check wheter $x$ is a solution to our search problem by preparing $\ket{x}\ket{0}$, applying the oracle, and checking to see if the oracle qubit has been flipped to $\ket{1}$.
\begin{equation}
  \ket{x}\frac{\ket{0}-\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}\xrightarrow{\operator}
  \ket{x}\frac{\ket{0\oplus f(x)}-\ket{1\oplus f(x)}}{\sqrt{2}}
  \equiv (-1)^{f(x)}\ket{x}\frac{\ket{0}-\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{equation}
Since the oracle qubit is left unchanged, we can disregard it and only focus on the $\ket{x}$. We have:
\begin{align*}
  &\ket{x}\xrightarrow{\operator}\ket{x}\,
  \text{if $x$ is not a solution},\\
  &\ket{x}\xrightarrow{\operator}-\ket{x}\,
  \text{if $x$ is a solution}.
\end{align*}
that is, the oracle marks a solution $x$ to the problem by shifting the phase of the corresponding qubit state $\ket{x}$.

\marginnote{Note that the oracle does not know the solution: it is just able to recognize a solution.}

\subsection{Grover operator}
We start our search problem with the $n$ qubits prepared in the state $\ket{0}$ and, then, we apply $n$ Hadamard transformations in order to generate a superposition of all possible states:
\begin{equation}
  H^{\otimes n}\ket{0}^{\otimes n}
  = \frac{1}{2^{n/2}}\sum_{x=0}^{N-1}\ket{x}\equiv\ket{\psi}
\end{equation}
Now we apply the so-called \textit{Grover iteration} or \textit{Grover operator} $\hat{G}$ which consists of the following four steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Apply the oracle $\operator$.
  \item Apply the Hadamard transform $H^{\otimes n}$.
  % marginnote
  \marginnote{Note that the conditional phase shift can be described by the unitary operator $2\ket{0}\bra{0}-I$.}
  \item Apply the conditional shift $\ket{x}\rightarrow-(-1)^{\delta_{x,0}}\ket{x}$, i.e., all the states but $\ket{0}$, which is unchanged.
  \item Apply the Hadamard transform $H^{\otimes n}$.
\end{enumerate}
It's useful to note that the combined effect of steps 2, 3, and 4 is
\begin{equation}
  H^{\otimes n}(2\ket{0}\bra{0}-I)H^{\otimes n}=
  2\bra{\psi}\ket{\psi}-I,
\end{equation}
therefore, the Grover operator can be written as:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{G}=\left(2\bra{\psi}\ket{\psi}-I\right)\operator.
\end{equation}
In the following we will see that applying $\hat{G}$ a certain number of times, one obtains a solution to the search problem with high probability.

\subsection{Geometric interpretation of the Grover operators}
By definition, the state $\ket{\psi}$ is a superposition of \textit{all} the possible states $\ket{x}\, x\in\{0,1,\ldots,N-1\}$. However, we can introduce the two sets $A$ and $B$, $A\cup B = \Omega$ and $A\cap B=\emptyset$, such that:
\begin{align*}
  &\text{if}\,x\in A\,\text{then}\,f(x)=0
  \Rightarrow\text{$x$ is not a solution},\\
  &\text{if}\,x\in B\,\text{then}\,f(x)=1
  \Rightarrow\text{$x$ is a solution}.
\end{align*}
Therefore we can define the two orthogonal states:
\begin{align*}
  \ket{\alpha}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N-M}}\sum_{x\in A}\ket{x},
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  \ket{\beta}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{M}}\sum_{x\in B}\ket{x},
\end{align*}
